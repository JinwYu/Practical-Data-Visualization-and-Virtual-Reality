# Practical-Data-Visualization-and-Virtual-Reality
C++ and x3d programming, which is a royalty-free ISO standard XML-based file format for representing 3D computer graphics. This repo has the labs in the course "Practical Data Visualization and Virtual Reality" at Linkoping University, 2014. I worked with the volume rendering engine Voreen, which allows interactive visualization of volumetric data sets and Virtual Reality: Tri-modal Interaction With Scene Graphs and Tracking and Multi-screen Display Systems.
